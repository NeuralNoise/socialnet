<!-- The search packet is used by a user who is seeking another user.
This might happen when a user does not know another's email address. Like
Facebook, people simply provide a full names which they use to search Facebook.

 
This aims to implement the same feature. This packet is generated when users use
the search feature in their clients. The packet is encrypted and signed by the
searcher and delivered to their friends. The friends then use the packet to look for matching users.
