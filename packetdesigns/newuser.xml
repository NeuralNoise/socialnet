<packet>

<!--
This packet is used when someone is joining the network. It published
the user's details that are needed to communicate.

The difficult part is bootstrapping a user on the network because it should
be encrypted. At this point, nobody knows this user's public keys so data must
be send unencrypted.

Bob (not on the social network) creates a new account in his client providing
his userprofile details.
He then needs to add at least one friend, he provides alice@example.com
as the email address. This is then what is sent to Alice.

Alice receives the newuser request and uses the public key sent within it to
reply.
