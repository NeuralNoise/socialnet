This is the design for the PHP client socialnetwork software.

There are two components that run on the server.

Monitor /inpackets folder for new files.
When a new file is detected, parse the file and convert it into a PHP object
that reflects the contents of the packet.

XML Transfer
===

How will the XML packets be transferred between client machines?
 - Email is the most likely choice because it is relatively instant and packets
 are preserved even if the recipient is offline.
  - XMPP would provide real time packet transfer and so client updates would be 
  instant.
  - BitTorrent protocol would provide reasonably fast packet transfer and would
  allow media to be shared quicker.

 1. A user creates an account using a client. This asks the user some details
 about themselves, including a login name, password and email address.

 2. The user is asked for some contact details of some friends. This is likely
 to be an email address or a website.

 3. The client attempts to bootstrap itself with the new contacts by sending
 newuser packets. In the meantime the user is welcome to begin creating a profile
 and writing about themselves. They can also see the progress of bootstrapping
 to the network. This could be represented by a graph visualization.

 4. If the original bootstrapped friends take a while to initially come online,
  the client will batch up all the user's changes to their profile before sending
  them all-at-once.

  5. The bootstrapping friends will spread the contact's existence with the same
  newuser packet which will be propagated throughout the network.

===
Email Integration
===

In order to ensure that the system is usable as a social interface the client
should also act as an email client. Users who do not have accounts will still
appear within the system as users who can be sent or receive private messages.

Email headers could use an ID.

===
Chat Integration
===

The chat integration can use other protocols for instant messaging such as the
XMPP protocol. Or even as the main protocol.
