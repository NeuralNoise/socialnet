How do users create 'accounts'?

 1. Users access the register/create an account in a client

 2. They are asked some details about themselves, such as:
  Name, Email address and a password.

 3. The client then generates a public and private key and an ACCOUNTFILE is created.
    The ACCOUNTFILE contains a private key and a USERPROFILE packet.

 4. The password that the user provided is used as the passphrase for the private key.
